## Initial considerations/concerns
- Our explanatory variables are mostly (if not entirely) categorical
  - What kind of recoding scheme should we use?
- Are any of the variables we're interested in correlated?
- What priors?
  - Should we incorporate prior information?
  - Jeffrey's prior bc logistic regression?
